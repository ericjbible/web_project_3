# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

### Overview
* Intro
* Figma
* Technology & Methodology Used

**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. I've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes so it is responsive. This was done as a part of the YPracticum Web Developer bootcamp for cohort 11 (Tomato Cohort).

**Technology & Methodology Used**

This project has been completed with use of the BEM methodology for class naming conventions and code file structure.

The following technologies and concepts were used in this project:
- Semantic HTML
- CSS with focus on specificity and inheritance
- Git/GitHub
- Browser Debugging (with dev tools)
- Image compression and optimization ([for SVGs](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) and [for PNGs](https://tinypng.com/))
